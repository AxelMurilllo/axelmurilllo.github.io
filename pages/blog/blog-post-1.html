                        <div class="post-meta">Posted on March 15, 2025</div>
                        
                        <div class="post-content">
                            <p>
                                When I decided to create my portfolio website, I wanted something that would stand out
                                and showcase not just my projects, but also my personality and attention to detail.
                                I chose to do the Windows retro style because it looked y2k and I liked the aesthetic.
                                I made this portfolio website in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In retrospect, I should have used React or
                                some other framework to make the website more efficient and easier to maintain. The site is mostly a jumble 
                                of hacked together code. It looks great to me though, and I am especially proud of the desktop icons and 
                                projects page.
                            </p>

                            <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first step was planning the layout and user experience. I had a few ideas in mind, but 
                                after looking at some templates, I found that I did not like any of the minimalist ShadCN/DaisyUI 
                                designs. They looked very generic and didn't inspire me much. I looked at old 2000s websites and liked
                                the chaos and lack of consistency across the site. I did add flexbox rules to make this portfolio site
                                look more cohesive.
                            </p>

                            <h2>The Code</h2>
                            <p>
                                This site is mostly HTML and CSS, so it is not 'real' programming. I did use JavaScript to make the 
                                desktop icons work, and to make the site more interactive. Working on the desktop icons was a fun challenge,
                                and I am proud of the results. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The desktop.js file implements the logic for the window management system through the following components:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Event Delegation:</strong> The script uses event bubbling to handle window interactions (dragging, resizing, minimizing) 
                                through a central event listener on the desktop container, rather than attaching listeners to each window.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Window State Management:</strong> Each window's state (position, size, z-index) is tracked and updated dynamically. 
                                The z-index stack ensures proper window layering when clicking between multiple windows.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Drag Implementation:</strong> Mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) are used to implement dragging. 
                                The script calculates offset positions and updates window coordinates in real-time.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Resize Functionality:</strong> A resize handle in the bottom-right corner triggers the resize mode. 
                                The script maintains aspect ratios and minimum dimensions while allowing smooth resizing through mousemove events.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Window Controls:</strong> The minimize, maximize, and close buttons are implemented through DOM manipulation, 
                                with state preservation for restore operations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The system uses CSS transforms for smooth animations (very important otherwise it looks laggy).
                                All window states are managed in memory, allowing for complex interactions like dragging partially 
                                off-screen windows or handling multiple overlapping windows efficiently.
                            </p>
